There are two types of synchronization.....
Process synchronization 
Thread Synchronization

Process Synchronization
	Term used to share resources between two or more processes
	
Critical Section
	Piece of code being shared but different processes is called as Critical Section
	
Semaphores
	Solution to avoid critical section is called as Semaphores.
	
Thread Synchronization
	Concurrent execution of two or more resource by two or more thread
	
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Examples-1. Synchronized Instance Method
			for each object there is only one thread then it can execute into object..
			But if there is more than one object then only single thread can execute 
			in the block of each object.
			
		 2. Synchronized Static Method
		 	we can mark static method as synchronized just like we marked 
		 	the instance methods using the synchronized keyword.
		 	
		 3. Synchronized Block inside Instance Methods
		 	If we do not want to synchronize whole method we can synchronize only the particular block
